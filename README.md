## Description

The Eternal Engine EA MT5 is an advanced forex algorithm that adapts to market conditions to exploit trading opportunities. It uses the MQL5 Trade module to execute trades based on market conditions.

## Initialization

In the `OnInit()` function, the trade module is initialized and necessary trade parameters are set. The expert magic number is set to 123456, deviation in points is set to 10, and margin mode is set to MARGIN_MODE_RETAIL_NETTING. Additionally, the trade session is set to true to enable round-the-clock functionality.

## Deinitialization

In the `OnDeinit()` function, the trade module is cleaned up by deleting it.

## Expert Tick

In the `OnTick()` function, the current market conditions are obtained by getting the bid and ask prices using the `SymbolInfoDouble()` function. An algorithm is implemented to adapt to subtle shifts in the market.

If the bid price is higher than the ask price, a buy order is executed using the `Buy()` function of the trade module. Capital protection mechanisms such as stop loss, take profit, and trailing stop are set.

If the ask price is higher than the bid price, a sell order is executed using the `Sell()` function of the trade module. Capital protection mechanisms such as stop loss, take profit, and trailing stop are set.

## Expert Start

In the `OnStart()` function, the EA runs continuously without manual intervention. The `OnTick()` function is called repeatedly using a while loop, and a sleep of 1000 milliseconds is added to control the execution speed.

Please note that this is a simplified explanation of how the code works. The actual algorithm and trading strategy may be more complex and customized based on the specific requirements of the product.
